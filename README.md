## How to Use

1.  **Download/Clone the Files**: Get `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.
2.  **Preview**: Open `index.html` in your browser to see the template in action.
3.  **Edit `index.html`**:
    - Open the file in a text editor.
    - **Personal Information**: Find and replace all placeholder text (e.g., "Your Name", "Your Title").
    - **Profile Picture**: Replace the placeholder image URL (`https://via.placeholder.com/150`) with a link to your own headshot.
    - **Content**: Fill in each `<section>` with your details.
    - **Links**: Update all `href="#"` placeholders with your actual URLs.
4.  **Deploy**: Upload the files to any static web hosting service (like GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or your university's web space).

## Customization

### Changing Fonts

The template uses 'Lato', 'Noto Sans', and 'Georgia' (for printing). To change them:
1.  Go to [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and select new fonts.
2.  Replace the `<link>` in the `<head>` of `index.html` with the one from Google Fonts.
3.  In `style.css`, update the `--font-primary`, `--font-secondary`, and `--font-print` CSS variables.

### Modifying Themes (Colors)

Colors for both themes are managed by CSS variables at the top of `style.css`.

```css
:root {
    /* ... */
    /* Dark Theme (v3 - Softer, more elegant blue/slate) */
    --bg-color-dark: #0f172a;
    --text-color-dark: #cbd5e1;
    /* ...etc. */
}
```

## Dependencies

This template uses two external JavaScript libraries for the PDF export feature, included via a CDN:
- **[jsPDF](https://github.com/parallax/jsPDF)**: For creating the PDF document.
- **[html2canvas](https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/)**: For capturing the page content as an image.

These are already included in `index.html` and require no extra setup.
